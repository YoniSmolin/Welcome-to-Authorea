<h1 id="auto-label-section-812642" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract<br></h1><div>As RGB-D sensors like Kinect become cheaper and more popular, it is interesting to look into the benefits of constructing arrays of such sensors. This report deals with the technical aspect of assembling a sensor network, each node of which is comprised of a an RGB-D sensor powered with a local processing unit. All the nodes are synchronized to a central processing unit. Thus, the network can perform both distributed and centralized logic and data processing. Such an network can be used as an efficient platform for various kinds of computer vision applications, including room mapping, event detection and tracking.<br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-451451" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-864479" class="ltx_title_section">Experimental Details<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-592286" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussions<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-691549" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions and Recommendations<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-539285" class="ltx_title_section">References<br></h1><div><br></div>
