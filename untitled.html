<h1 id="auto-label-section-812642" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract<br></h1><div>As RGB-D sensors like Kinect become cheaper and more popular, it is interesting to look into the benefits of constructing arrays of such sensors. This report deals with the technical aspect of assembling a sensor network. Each node int the network is comprised of an RGB-D sensor and is powered with a local processing unit. All the nodes are synchronized to a single central processing unit. Thus, the network can perform both distributed and centralized processing. Such a network can be used as an efficient platform for various kinds of computer vision applications, including room mapping, event detection and tracking.<br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-451451" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction<br></h1><div>The concrete network discussed in this report is comprised of a set of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/purchase/" target="_blank">Microsoft Kinect v2</a>&nbsp;sensors, each paired with a single NVidia Jetson TK1 development board.<br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-864479" class="ltx_title_section">Experimental Details<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-592286" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussions<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-691549" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions and Recommendations<br></h1><div><br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-539285" class="ltx_title_section">References<br></h1><div><br></div>
