<h1 id="auto-label-section-812642" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract<br></h1><div>As RGB-D sensors like Kinect become cheaper and more popular, it is interesting to look into the benefits of constructing arrays of such sensors. This report deals with the technical aspect of assembling a sensor network. Each node int the network is comprised of an RGB-D sensor and is powered with a local processing unit. All the nodes are synchronized to a single central processing unit. Thus, the network can perform both distributed and centralized processing. Such a network can be used as an efficient platform for various kinds of computer vision applications, including room mapping, event detection and tracking.<br></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-451451" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction<br></h1><div>The concrete system discussed in this report is comprised of a set of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/purchase/" target="_blank">Microsoft Kinect v2</a>&nbsp;sensors, each paired with a single <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/jetson-tk1-embedded-dev-kit.html" target="_blank">Nvidia Jetston TK1</a> developer board. Each Kinect is connected to its corresponding Jetson board via USB3.0. The boards are all connected to the local network via ethernet and can be controlled by any computer which is also connected to this network. An illustration of the system, for the case of 4 sensors, is shown in the figure below.<br></div><div><br></div>
